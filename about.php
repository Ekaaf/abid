                    Mr. Abid Habib, Ex-Director-Construction Division of Abdul Monem Limited, has served as one of the exceptional Engineers of our nation. He has completed his graduation from <b><i>Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)</i></b> , Dhaka in the year 1981, from 'Civil Engineering' department.
                    <br><br>
                    Right after the graduation, he had joined a flourishing company called Abdul Monem Limited (AML). Although, he began his journey as a '<b>Junior Engineer</b>' yet he had an ambition to establish himself as one of the superior and top-notch infrastructure developers of Bangladesh.
                    <br><br>

                    He began his journey of infrastructure development from building- <i>The Khulna-Mongla Road under Roads and Highways Department</i> as an 'Assistant Engineer'. Within a 7 years interval, he abundantly devoted himself in the AML company, that Mr. Abdul Monem, Chairmen of AML, choose him to supervise the most promising and challenging construction projects of AML as the '<b>Project Manager</b>'. Under his in-charge projects like Flood damage restoration works, Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Projects (RRMP), Road improvement projects (RIP) and many more were accomplished.

                    <br><br>

                    Each of his work urged professionals and experts in this field, to mark him as one of the most talented Engineers of his time. The rapid progress and expansion of Abdul Monem Limited company, with the help of Mr. Abid Habib was exceedingly apparent to everyone. Mr. Abdul Monem could presume that Mr. Abid Habib has surpassed all the level of expectations, hence he transferred an unconditional power of attorney to him and made him lead his construction business as the '<b>Director-Construction Division and Authorised Representative</b>' of AML, along with all signatory rights.

                    <br><br>

                    Undoubtedly, this was an incredible decision made by Mr. Abdul Monem. Mr Abid Habib was not only worthy of this position but also, he was the only one who could sustain these huge responsibilities of conducting country’s major construction projects. 

                    <br><br>

                    Despite the fact that Mr. Abid Habib had attained what he deserved, he was yet to proliferate his expertise on a much bigger scale. He used all his knowledge, skills, wisdom and experiences to build his reputation and esteem in this construction industry. Mr. Abid Habib not only made himself as one of the assets for the country but also made 'Abdul Monem Limited' as one of the largest, reliable and honourable infrastructures developing firm.  

                    <br><br>

                    Mr Abid Habib's qualities of integrity, sincerity, honesty, commitment and in-depth knowledge of business and professional ethics attracted the Japanese construction companies. The Japanese companies were overwhelmed with his virtuosity of administration, supervision, sovereignty, and managerial skills and hence they finally decided to work in Bangladesh jointly with AML, under Mr. Abid Habib’s leadership. And as a result, Abdul Monem Limited became the only firm that had the opportunity to work jointly with the Japanese Construction Companies in modelling, structuring and building <b>The Metro Rail project</b>, one of Bangladesh's major construction plans.

                    <br><br>

                    Within this 38 years, Mr. Abid Habib has procured and developed numerous infrastructures and accomplished many projects. Under his signatory rights in AML, he has carried out more than 36 number of projects, and more are on the chain of being procured. 

                    <br><br>

                    Attaining the highest level of success never influenced Mr. Abid Habib to lose his bond and loyalty to his roots. As he was from Khulna, he had always wanted to support the local residents. As a result, being the president of Lion's Club of Khulna, Paigram Kasba, Phultala he established a diabetes centre, named <i><b>Lion-Shilpi Diabetes Care Centre</b></i> in his own property, to facilitate treatments at nominal price for underprivileged local inhabitants. 

                    <br><br>

                    Furthermore, throughout these 38 years of working as a Civil Engineer, Mr. Abid Habib has earned a lot of respect in this field with his determination and diligences. His ability of understanding every detail in contract provision, relevant laws, executing the contract in international standards and magnificent interpersonal and communication skills made him a top leader in the infrastructure development industry of Bangladesh. In addition, he has also been certified as a 'Professional Engineer' (P.Eng) under Bangladesh Professional Engineers Registration Boards (BPERB).

                    <br><br>

                    Accordingly, he is very eager and enthusiastic to pass on his intelligence, insights, and judgements to the new generation, by engaging in '<b>Advanced Management of Project Engineering Limited (AMPEL)</b>' company as the <b>Founder, Chairmen and Managing Director</b>.
